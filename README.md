# Setting up Proximity Chat on Windows (FABRIC INSTALLATION & RECOMMENDED)
Note that when downloading these files they will mark as a virus. This is due to the mod files being able to modify directory files on your computer and this applies to most .JAR files and is safe to do.

First you will need to install Fabric. To do so, find the file above called "__Fabic-Installer.exe__". Make sure to have Minecraft and the launcher closed while installing Fabric. Run the program, and once the application pops up you need to click on the dropdown and press "1.18.1". Make sure the loader version is the newest and click "install". You will know you did it right if this pops up:

*"Fabric Loader 0.12.12 for 1.18.1 has been successfully installed. Many mods also require you to put Fabric API into the mods folder."*

Next you will install Fabric API. In the files above, find the one that says "__Fabric-API.jar__" and download it.
