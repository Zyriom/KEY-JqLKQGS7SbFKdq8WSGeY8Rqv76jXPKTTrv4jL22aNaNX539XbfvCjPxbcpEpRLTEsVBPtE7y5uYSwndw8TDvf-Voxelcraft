# Voxelcraft - GitHub
This is the Voxelcraft's official repository GitHub. Files, and text from important info channels are listed here for people to read.

Do not share the link with anyone. There is a reason for the name of the github and why it is written in a token-like format. You do not need to read the sections below unless you have not already in the Discord. If you do not understand installation steps you can either ask a staff member on the Discord or watch a video on how.

# Setting up Proximity Chat on Windows (FABRIC & RECOMMENDED)
Note that when downloading these files they will mark as a virus. This is due to the mod files being able to modify directory files on your computer and this applies to most .JAR files and is safe to do.

First you will need to install Fabric. To do so, find the file above called "__Fabic-Installer.exe__". Make sure to have Minecraft and the launcher closed while installing Fabric. Run the program, and once the application pops up you need to click on the dropdown and press "1.18.1". Make sure the loader version is the newest and click "install". You will know you did it right if this pops up:

*"Fabric Loader 0.12.12 for 1.18.1 has been successfully installed. Many mods also require you to put Fabric API into the mods folder."*

Next you will install Fabric API. In the files above, find the one that says "__Fabric-API.jar__" and download it. You will now need to make a mods folder. Press WINDOWS_KEY + R and when the thing pops up put into the search bar "__%appdata%__" and press enter. When file explorer opens, find the file that says "__.minecraft__" and open it. In there press "New Folder" and rename it to "__mods__". This is case sensitive. do not put any capitals or the folder will not work. Inside the folder you will want to put the file you downloaded, __Fabric-API.jar__. Do not close the folder yet. In the files above, download "__VoiceChat (Fabric).jar__" and also put that into your "__mods__" folder. close all folders and open minecraft launcher. Next to the play button there will be a new installation with the Fabric icon. Leave it as that and press play to run minecraft. If you did it correctly, when you join the server and press "V" there will be a menu that shows up that looks like this:

You have now successfully installed Proximity Chat! All you have to do now is change the settings on the voice chat menu and you're all set! 

__NOTE: (Only players with the mod installed can hear you on the server. Ask people to download this mod too, it's really cool.)__
